# Konsta UI Svelte

Konsta UI - is a free and open source mobile UI components framework built with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com).

```html
<script>
  import { App, Page, Navbar, Block } from 'konsta/svelte';
</script>
<App theme="ios">
  <Page>
    <Navbar title="My App" />

    <Block strong>Hello world!</Block>
  </Page>
</App>
```

It is designed to develop hybrid mobile apps, [Web Native](https://webnative.tech) apps or web apps with iOS & Android native look and feel.

It is highly recommended for you to be familiar with basics of both [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) before getting started.

Current documentation doesn't cover the process of compilation of Konsta UI app to [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org) or [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com) app. It is about Konsta UI and how to use all of its components. To learn more about how to compile your app to hybrid [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org) or [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com) app that can be released at iOS and Google Play store refer to their official documentations.

Konsta UI [Kitchen Sink](/svelte/kitchen-sink) is also a great place to get started, it has a lot examples for all Konsta UI components and covers most of aspects.

Ok, so first of all we need to learn [how to install](/svelte/installation) Konsta UI
