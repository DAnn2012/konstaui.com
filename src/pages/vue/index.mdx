# Konsta UI Vue

Konsta UI - is a free and open source mobile UI components framework built with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com).

```html
<template>
  <k-app theme="ios">
    <k-page>
      <k-navbar title="My App" />

      <k-block strong>Hello world!</k-block>
    </k-page>
  </k-app>
</template>
<script>
  import { kApp, kPage, kNavbar, kBlock } from 'konsta/vue';

  export default {
    components: {
      kApp,
      kPage,
      kNavbar,
      kBlock,
    },
  };
</script>
```

It is designed to develop hybrid mobile apps, [Web Native](https://webnative.tech) apps or web apps with iOS & Android native look and feel.

It is highly recommended for you to be familiar with basics of both [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) before getting started.

Current documentation doesn't cover the process of compilation of Konsta UI app to [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org) or [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com) app. It is about Konsta UI and how to use all of its components. To learn more about how to compile your app to hybrid [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org) or [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com) app that can be released at iOS and Google Play store refer to their official documentations.

Konsta UI [Kitchen Sink](/vue/kitchen-sink) is also a great place to get started, it has a lot examples for all Konsta UI components and covers most of aspects.

Ok, so first of all we need to learn [how to install](/vue/installation) Konsta UI
