# App React Component

App React component is the main app component that allows to define global theme (iOS or Material) and other useful globals.

If you use Tailwind Mobile with other framework (like [Framework7](https://framework7.io) or [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com)), you should use [TailwindMobileProvider](/react/tailwind-mobile-provider) instead.

## App Components

There are following components included:

- `App`

## App Props

<AppProps />

## Examples

`App` component should be used as main wrapper for all Tailwind Mobile components, and there should be only one `App` component at a time in the app:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { App } from 'tailwind-mobile/react';

export default function MyApp() {
  return (
    <>
      {/* App component ideally should be the main root component */}
      <App theme="ios" safeAreas>
        {/* rest of Tailwind Mobile components */}
      </App>
    </>
  );
}
```
