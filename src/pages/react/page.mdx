# Page React Component

Page is the main component to display and operate content.

If you use Tailwind Mobile with [Framework7](https://framework7.io) or [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com), you probably don't need this component and you should use Page components (or similar) from these frameworks.

## Page Components

There are following components included:

- `Page`

## Page Props

<PageProps />
