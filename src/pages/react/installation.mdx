# Installation

We assume you already have a configured project with [React and Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) .

## Install Tailwind Mobile

At first, we need to install the Tailwind Mobile library:

```
npm i tailwind-mobile
```

## Add Config

Then, we need to extend our Tailwind CSS config with Tailwind Mobile config.

In your `tailwind.config.js` file:

```js
const tailwindMobileConfig = require('tailwind-mobile/config');

// wrap your config with tailwindMobileConfig
module.exports = tailwindMobileConfig({
  // rest of your usual Tailwind CSS config here
  ...
});
```

`tailwindMobileConfig` will extend default (or your custom one) Tailwind CSS config with some extra variants and helper utilities required for Tailwind Mobile.

## Usage

After installation process is done let's check [how to use Tailwind Mobile components](/react/usage) in our React application.
